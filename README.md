<h2>  About: </h2>

How To Craft Steel and Weapons: 

>* First Build the Steelworks Forge. We will also need the Steelworks Kiln, Steel Bar Mould, and SlackTub.
>* We can then craft Surtling Coal and our Crucible - this is crafted on the forge using Surtling Cores and Coal, the Crucible is crafted with IronScrap and Coal.
>* Place the Crucilbe into the Steelworks Kiln with the Surtling Coal, keep that fire toasty!
>* Once completed we will have the Molten Steel - Pour that into the Steelworks Mold and let it cool.
>* After cooled a bit we can toss the hot steel into the SlackTub to oxidize it - This will give us our Steel Bars we can use for crafting the Weapon Display or SteelBarStacks.
>* If we want to create a weapon we simply take the Steel Bars and heat them in the Kiln so that we can forge a weapon at the Steelcrafting Forge.
>* We can also put the hot steel bars back into the SlackTub should we want to cool them again for crafting stacks and weapon stands.
>* 2 handed swords, crossbows, axes, swords, polearms, daggers, maces, and more, there are over 120 weapons for you to set configs for.


**IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS MOD USES THE LATEST MISTLANDS ITEMMANAGER! Mods using the older versions may cause crafting tables or chests to not work properly when running them with new mods built on the latest ItemManager, those mods will need updated.
